## Contributing

The steps in brackets can be skipped if you already have Ruby development stuff on your machine

* fork the repo
* git clone your version of the repo
* (install Ruby if you don't already have it - my recommendation is to do this with [RVM](https://rvm.io)
* (install bundler gem - `gem install bundler`)
* `bundle install` - this installs Jekyll and any gem dependencies it needs
* `jekyll serve` - this starts the Jekyll development server
* information on how to use Jekyll is [here](https://jekyllrb.com)
* make your changes
* commit and push your changes to GitHub
